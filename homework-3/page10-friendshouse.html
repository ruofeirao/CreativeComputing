		You knock on the door.
	</h1>

	<br>

	<p>
		Your friend Bob opens the door. He asks what the heck you're doing at his house, and you say you're bored and hungry. He looks at you pitifully and says "Alright, come inside."
	</p>

	<p>
		You enter Bob's house and he says "Let's play video games and order pizza." You say "Great idea, Bob!" He gives you three options for pizza:
	</p>

	<p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Cheese
			</li>
			<li>
				Pepperoni
			</li>
			<li>
				Supreme
			</li>
		</ol>
	</p>

	<p>
		You say you don't mind. While he orders online, he tells you to pick a game. Which do you want to play?
